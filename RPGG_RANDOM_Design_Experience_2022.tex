\DndDropCapLine{R}{andom tables} are the primordial ooze from which all games
originate. The Geeks of
\href{https://rpggeek.com/}{RPGG}
present the results of their enthusiastic enumeration of eclectic effects - AKA
the
\href{https://rpggeek.com/thread/2942480/2022-r-n-d-o-m-design-experience}{RPGG
R-A-N-D-O-M Design Experience} of 2022.

We did this in 2016 and it worked. Oops, we did it again in 2017. Then we forgot
about it for 2 years. Then we did 2020. And it worked. As Ned Flanders
might say:
\begin{DndReadAloud}
Ding dang diddly! If we did it once, we can do it again!
\end{DndReadAloud}

The theme this year was \emph{events that I don't want to go through all the
trouble to run}.
